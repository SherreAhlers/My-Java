        // public is an access modifier we discussed when defining the class.
        // static is a Java keyword that needs an understanding of other concepts, for now, know that we need to have static
        // for Java to find our method to run the code we are going to add.
        // void is yet another Java keyword used to indicate that the method will not return anything.
        // the left and right parenthesis in a method declaration are mandatory and can optionally include one or more parameters
        // which is a way to pass information to a method.
        System.out.println("Hello World");
        // must have semi colon to end statement or will get an error.

    }
}
// exit code 0 means eveything was executed properly

// code block is used to define a block of code. Its mandatory to have one in a method declaration and its here where we will be adding statements to perform certain tasks.

// statement - this is a complete command to be executed and can include one or more expressions.
